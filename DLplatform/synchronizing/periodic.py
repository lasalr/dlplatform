        Periodic synchronization mechanism. This method is called by the coordinator during the balancing process.

        ----------
        nodesDict - dictionary of node identifiers as keys and their parameters as values that are in violation or requested for balancing
        activeNodes - list of nodes' identifiers that are active currently
